      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed max-w-3xl">
        I’m <span className="font-semibold">Desmond Harry Adebowale</span>, 
        a driven computer science graduate with a strong foundation in 
        programming, cloud computing, and data visualization. 
        I’ve built and deployed applications using AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3), 
        SQL, Python, and JavaScript, while also exploring front-end and back-end development. 
        <br /><br />
        My journey includes hands-on experience as a Computer Science Intern at Jenzabar, 
        supporting IT-related tickets, working with SQL, Java, and C++ projects, 
        and learning software development workflows. I’ve also contributed as a 
        Resident Assistant at NCTC, gaining leadership and problem-solving skills 
        while supporting a diverse student community.
        <br /><br />
        With certifications in responsive web design and JavaScript algorithms, 
        I’m eager to keep learning and contribute to a growth-focused company 
        in software engineering or data roles. I value teamwork, adaptability, 
        and continuous growth while delivering solutions that improve efficiency 
        and business outcomes.
